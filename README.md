# Java Date Class Project

## Project Overview
As a beginner in Java, this project was an exciting challenge to implement a `Date` class that can handle various operations related to dates. The goal of this project was to create a `Date` class with fundamental functionality such as validating dates, updating them, calculating the day of the week, and sorting a list of `Date` objects.

This project covers the basics of object-oriented programming in Java, including the creation of classes, methods, and constructors. Through this project, I also gained experience in handling real-world scenarios like leap years and date differences, which are key when working with date-related applications.

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Date Validation (`isValidDate`)**: Ensures that a date is valid by checking if the day, month, and year fall within reasonable ranges. The validation also considers leap years, which is essential for handling dates like February 29.
  
- **Update Date (`updateDate`)**: Allows updating the day, month, and year attributes of the `Date` object, but only after validating that the new date is valid.

- **Day of the Week (`getDayOfWeek`)**: Returns the name of the day (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday") for any given date. This involved using Java's built-in `Calendar` class.

- **Date Difference (`calculateDifference`)**: Computes the difference (in days) between two `Date` objects. This is done by converting the dates into `Calendar` objects and calculating the difference in milliseconds.

- **Sorting Dates (`compareTo`)**: Implements the `Comparable<Date>` interface to allow sorting a list of `Date` objects in ascending order based on the year, month, and day.

### Why This Project Was Valuable:
- **Real-World Application**: Working with dates is a fundamental part of many real-world applications, and this project provided me with a solid understanding of how to handle them in Java.
  
- **Hands-on Learning**: As a beginner, implementing the `Date` class from scratch helped me understand how to structure a class, write methods, and apply Java's built-in libraries effectively.

- **Challenges and Learning**: 
    - One of the biggest challenges was handling leap years and ensuring the validation method could correctly identify valid and invalid dates, such as February 29 on non-leap years.
    - I also learned how to use the `Comparable` interface to sort objects in Java, which I had not previously worked with.


## Compilation and Execution Instructions

Follow these steps to compile and run the Java program.

### 1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - **Clone the repository** using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Java-Date-Class.git
     ```
   - Or, **download the project** as a ZIP file from the repository's GitHub page.

### 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   After cloning or downloading the repository, navigate to the project folder where `Main.java` is located.
   ```bash
   cd Java-Date-Class


## Additional Notes or Challenges

### Key Learnings and Challenges
- **Leap Year Handling**: One of the primary challenges in this project was ensuring the correct handling of leap years. For example, February 29th is only valid in a leap year. Implementing this logic required careful checking of the year and ensuring the validation method accounted for leap years accurately.
  
- **Date Validation**: Another significant challenge was validating dates, especially for months with different numbers of days. For example, ensuring that February doesn’t have more than 29 days, or that April only has 30 days, was a critical part of the program’s functionality.

- **Date Sorting**: Implementing the sorting of dates using the `Comparable` interface was a great learning experience. Sorting the dates by year, then month, and then day was straightforward once I understood how to use the `compareTo` method effectively.

### Things to Improve
- **Error Handling**: Although the program checks for invalid dates and prints error messages, I could have used more robust error handling with `try-catch` blocks or custom exceptions. This would allow the program to handle unexpected inputs more gracefully.

- **User Interaction**: At the moment, the program is hardcoded to test specific dates. Adding user interaction where a user can input a date or choose from a set of options would enhance the program’s usability.

- **Date Arithmetic**: In future improvements, I plan to add functionality to perform date arithmetic, such as adding or subtracting days, months, or years. This will make the `Date` class more versatile.

### Overall Experience
This project was a great opportunity to apply object-oriented programming principles, including class design, constructors, and methods. As a beginner, it helped me understand the importance of edge cases (such as invalid dates) and how to handle them in Java. I also gained hands-on experience working with Java’s `Calendar` and `GregorianCalendar` classes to manipulate and calculate dates.

By completing this project, I strengthened my understanding of Java’s date-related functionality and solidified my foundation in object-oriented programming.
