## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a `Date` class in Java, which represents dates and provides various operations to manipulate and display them. The `Date` class has attributes for the day, month, and year, with constructors to initialize them. It includes methods to validate dates, calculate the difference between two dates, determine the day of the week, and display the date in a readable format.

Additionally, the project implements sorting functionality for a list of `Date` objects using the `Comparable` interface. The `compareTo` method allows the dates to be sorted by year, month, and day in ascending order. The program demonstrates fundamental Java concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, methods, and exception handling, providing a hands-on introduction to Java development for beginners.

Key features of the project:
- **Date validation**: Ensures that the date entered is valid, including leap year handling.
- **Date update**: Allows updating an existing `Date` object with a new date after validation.
- **Day of the week calculation**: Determines which day of the week a given date falls on.
- **Date difference**: Calculates the difference in days between two `Date` objects.
- **Sorting**: Allows sorting a list of `Date` objects in ascending order.

This project serves as an introduction to object-oriented programming and Javaâ€™s standard library features.
## Compilation and Execution Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usernamedia/Java-Date-Class.git
   ## Additional Notes or Challenges

- **Challenges Faced**:
   - **Date Validation**: Ensuring accurate date validation, especially for leap years, was a key challenge. The logic had to account for different month lengths and handle the edge cases of February 29th.
   - **Sorting Dates**: Implementing the `compareTo` method for sorting dates in ascending order (by year, then month, and finally day) was tricky, especially with varying day and month values.
   
- **Future Improvements**:
   - **User Input**: Adding functionality for users to input dates dynamically rather than hardcoding them into the program.
   - **Advanced Date Operations**: Implementing features like adding days to a given date or finding the next valid date in a sequence.
   - **Error Handling**: Improving error handling and providing more descriptive error messages for invalid inputs.
   
- **Key Learnings**:
   - Through this project, I gained experience in working with Java's `Calendar` and `GregorianCalendar` classes, which helped in calculating day of the week and date differences.
   - I also enhanced my understanding of object-oriented programming principles, particularly how to manage objects, validate attributes, and implement sorting algorithms using the `Comparable` interface.
